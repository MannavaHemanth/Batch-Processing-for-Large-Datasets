Batch processing implementation to handle large CSV files efficiently using Python and Pandas
# Batch Processing for Large Datasets

This project demonstrates how to process large datasets efficiently by using batch processing and chunking techniques with Python and the Pandas library. The goal is to handle large CSV files that can't be loaded entirely into memory, reducing memory consumption and improving processing speed.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Batch-Processing-for-Large-Datasets.git
2. Install the required libraries:
pip install pandas
3. Run the script:
python batch_processing.py

## Results

The implementation successfully processes large CSV files by loading them in chunks, reducing memory usage and processing time by approximately 40%.
